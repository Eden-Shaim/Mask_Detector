# Mask_Detector

* In order to use our trained model, please run -> predict.py
* The Predict module dwonloads the trained model from our Drive as it is too big to upload.
* Our best model for the proper_mask_prediction & bbox prediction tasks is fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn, trained from scratch on the given data
* The fasterrcnn_train file contains model creation, traning & evaluation.
