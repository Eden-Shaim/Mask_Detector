# Mask_Detector

* In order to use our best trained model, please run -> predict.py
* The Predict.py script downloads the best trained model from G-Drive as it is too big to upload to GitHub.
* Our best model for the proper_mask_prediction & bbox prediction tasks is fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn, trained from scratch on the given dataset
* The fasterrcnn_train.py file contains model creation, traning & evaluation.

* In order to train the models, we assume there is a data folder with train/ test folder inside.
